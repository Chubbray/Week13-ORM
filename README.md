# E-commerce Back End Starter Code
I first started with the models getting them set up.
I then put in the associations into the index.js models
Then I moved onto the routes api. I did get help form my tutor to get these set up.
After geting eveything set up I tried to run it and got a lot of errors.
I worked with one of the TA's to work through the errors. We had to modify one of models and I had extra code in the server that we had to take out.
Once all of the code was fixed he pointed out that I needed to run it from the develop folder not the fantastic-umbrella folder.
When I cd into the right folder every worked.
